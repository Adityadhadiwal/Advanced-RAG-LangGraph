# ðŸ”Ž Advanced RAG with LangGraph

**Advanced-RAG-LangGraph** is an advanced web application that implements a powerful Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using LangGraph. It combines the flexibility of **Streamlit** for an interactive user interface, **ChromaDB** as a vector database for efficient document retrieval, and **Tavily** for online search capabilities. This repository extends the traditional RAG framework with additional flows for robust error handling and reducing hallucinations in generated answers.

## Features

- **Document Upload and Embedding**:
  - Upload text files directly through the web interface.
  - Automatically converts the content into vector embeddings and stores them in **ChromaDB** for fast and accurate retrieval.

- **Interactive Q&A**:
  - Ask questions about the uploaded document's content.
  - If the answer exists in the document, it is retrieved from the vector store.
  - The application queries online sources via **Tavily**if the answer is not found.

- **Enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**:
  - Uses **LangGraph**, offering advanced features beyond traditional RAG implementations.
  - Employs conditional workflows to handle edge cases:
    - Fall back to alternative sources if the answers generated are inadequate.
    - Detect and address hallucinations to ensure reliable responses.

- **Tracing and Debugging**:
  - Integrates with **LangSmith** for tracing and debugging the LangGraph workflows.

## How It Works

1. **Upload a Document**:
   - Users can upload text files to the web application.
   - The content is embedded into vector representations and stored in **ChromaDB**.
   


2. **Ask Questions**:
   - Users type their questions in the query box.
   - The system retrieves the most relevant answers from the vector database or queries online using Tavily.
   


3. **Advanced Handling**:
   - Implements fallback logic for unanswered questions.
   - Detects and mitigates hallucinations in generated answers.
   


4. **Tracing with LangSmith**:
   - Visualize and debug LangGraph workflows using LangSmith.
